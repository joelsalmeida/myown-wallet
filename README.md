### What I learned

Without a doubt, this was one of the most fun projects I've done at Trybe. In addition to reviewing the content about React Router, API consumption, I was able to learn about the main concepts of Redux.

As an application grows, it can be tricky to manage states with just passing props. I came across this problem in a previous project and it was great to solve it with this new and challenging tool.

Also, it was interesting to work with GitHub Pages with a React application using React Router. As a good developer, I spent time understanding the problem and doing research until I was able to upload the application perfectly. :)

### Continued development

I want to practice the Redux Toolkit approach some more. In addition, delving into good practices is always good.
